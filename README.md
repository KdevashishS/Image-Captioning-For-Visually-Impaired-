IMAGE CAPTIONING FOR VISUALLY IMPAIREDIMAGE CAPTIONING FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED

Objective of this project was to generate captions for visually challenged and giving those generated captions speech which was practically more helpful. My role in this project was to develop the model based on the above requirements mentioned. This was accomplished by using pre-trained CNN model VGG16 for feature extraction and RNNmodel LSTM was used for caption generation. The text-to-speech part was achieved using gTTS library.
